## Monitoring emerging variants

As part of the UK pandemic response, we develop methods to identify and monitor emerging variants of interest. Your job today is to look at clusters of interest, including specific lineages or lineage and mutation combinations, and report on growth rates. We wil look at outputs from the scanning tool designed for Public Health England (PHE) as part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response to monitor emerging variants of interest or concern. 

#### PHE situation report

Imagine the date is the 28th of May, 2021. PHE has requested a situation report on the top 20 growth clusters of interest, as well as clusters associated to mutations **S:L452R**, **S:K417N**, and **S:Q677H**. This report should be about three pages in length, and include figures or tables from the scanning tool as part of the report. Factors to consider when writing your report: 

1. Which lineages are the highest growth rate lineages? 
2. Where are these lineages occuring in the population? (Use google maps to look up UK locations if uncertain)
3. How does their growth look over time? What about their frequency? How many LTLAs do we see them in? 
4. How do age distributions look in these lineages of interest? 
5. What about vaccinations? What information do we have on vaccinations?
6. Do we see any mutations of interest or concern (to be discussed further in the mutations section below)? 
7. How might current non-pharmaceutical interventions impact growth rates (remember the date is 28/05/2021)? 


_**N.B** You will include this report as part of the summative SuS Revolutions in Biomedicine portfolio. You are not expected to complete this report in the practical period, so please take the time to discuss outputs with your classmates as you work through the practical together._


#### Lineage nomenclature

Table 1. provides a reference of lineages of interest or concern that you should consider looking at in the scanner outputs. Please note, all scanner outputs utlise the pangolin lineage nomenclature, but feel free to call these be either WHO, pangolin lineage nomenclature or VOC/VUI designation in your report write up.

#### Growth rates from scanner output

Figure 1 shows growth rates for all clusters in the most recent scanner run, with date of last sample from the cluster of interest on the x axis. Although there are quite a few clusters on the page, notice that we can toggle clusters with specific lineages on and off. Although clusters can contain more than one lineage, we identify which lineage is most prominent in a cluster and label a cluster as lineage +. Questions to consider when looking at growth rates between clusters. Which clusters show the highest growth rates? How late are the sample dates? Do we see clusters with high growth rates but no recent samples included in the cluster? 




Specifically, what do we see happening with B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2? B.1.1.7 has been the dominant lineage in circulation since the start of the pandemic. How large (number of sequences) are the clusters for lineages of interest? 













This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
